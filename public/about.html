<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hii, my name is Khushi Verma and i am currently in my second year of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. I love to explore
   new places, foods, meeting new people. I have the passion for coding and problem-solving. Proficient in languages including C,
    Python and SQL,with a keen interest in leveraging technology to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. 
</p>

<p>Eager to dive into the dynamic world of innovation and technology, besides this i like to do certain things as well that includes 
   dancing, singing(not a expert), playing badmintion(well i'm good at it), reading books, cooking, journalising my day, 
   etc. etc. 
</p>

<p> Well now speaking as a person i'm an extrovert who likes to talk to people and is a risktaker(doesn't mean i have taken multiple till now
    but some, yeah). I am confident, caring, loves to speak, have a very strong personality, loves to spend time with my loved ones
    (and with myself)
    That's it , that is pretty much of my description!
